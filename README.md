Generative AI systems are rapidly being adopted and deployed across organizations. While they enhance productivity and efficiency, they also expand the attack surface.

How do you detect abusive usage of your system? How do you hunt for malicious prompts? Whether it is identifying jailbreaking attempts, preventing reputational damage, or spotting unexpected behaviors, tracking prompt TTPs can be very useful to track the usage of your AI systems.

That's where NOVA comes in!

🚧 **Disclaimer:** NOVA is currently in beta. Expect potential bugs, incomplete features, and ongoing improvements. If you identify a bug, please [report it here](https://github.com/fr0gger/nova-framework/issues).

NOVA is an open-source prompt pattern matching system combining keyword detection, semantic similarity, and LLM-based evaluation to analyze and detect prompt content.

## Features

- 🔍 **Keyword Detection:** Flag suspicious prompts using predefined keywords or regex.
- 💬 **Semantic Similarity:** Identify pattern variations using configurable thresholds.
- ✨ **LLM Matching:** Create matching rules using natural language evaluated by LLM.

Inspired by YARA syntax, NOVA rules are readable and flexible, ideal for prompt hunting and threat detection.

## Anatomy of a NOVA Rule

```bash
rule RuleName
{
    meta:
        description = "Rule description"
        author = "Author name"

    keywords:
        $keyword1 = "exact text"
        $keyword2 = /regex pattern/i

    semantics:
        $semantic1 = "semantic pattern" (0.6)

    llm:
        $llm_check = "LLM evaluation prompt" (0.7)

    condition:
        keywords.$keyword1 or semantics.$semantic1 or llm.$llm_check
}
```

## Installation

NOVA offers flexible installation options based on your needs:

### Basic Installation (Keywords Only)
For basic keyword and regex pattern matching:
```bash
pip install nova-hunting
```

### Full Installation (Recommended)
For complete functionality including semantic matching and LLM evaluation:
```bash
pip install nova-hunting[llm]
```

### Development Installation
For development work with testing and documentation tools:
```bash
pip install nova-hunting[dev]
```

### Installation Options Summary
- **Basic**: `pip install nova-hunting` - Keywords and regex only (~5MB)
- **LLM**: `pip install nova-hunting[llm]` - Full functionality (~1GB+ with ML models)
- **Dev**: `pip install nova-hunting[dev]` - Development tools included
- **All**: `pip install nova-hunting[all]` - Everything including docs

> **Note**: The basic installation is much lighter (~5MB) and perfect if you only need keyword/regex matching. The LLM installation includes large machine learning models (~1GB+) needed for semantic similarity and LLM evaluation features.
