# Nova Rules Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored all Nova rule files (`.nov`) in the `nova_rules/` directory according to the new format specification.

## Changes Applied

### 1. UUID Field Relocation
- **Before**: `uuid` was located inside the `meta` section
- **After**: `uuid` is now at the top level, immediately after the opening brace

### 2. Direction Field Added
- Added `direction` field inside the `meta` section
- Default value: `"input"` for most rules
- Special cases:
  - `llm02_SensitiveInfo.nov`: Uses `"output"` (for sensitive information disclosure detection)
  - `llm05_ImproperOutput.nov`: Uses `"output"` (for unsafe output handling)

### 3. False Positives Section Added
- Added `falsepositives` section at the end of each rule
- Contains contextually appropriate false positive scenarios
- Provides guidance for legitimate use cases that might trigger the rule

3. ✅ `202402_forest_blizzard.nov` - 2 rules refactored (UUIDs added)

## Total Statistics
- **Files Modified**: 16
- **Total Rules Refactored**: 49+
- **New UUIDs Generated**: 9 (for incident files that lacked UUIDs)

## Format Example

### Before:
```nova
rule ExampleRule
{
    meta:
        description = "Example rule"
        author = "Author Name"
        version = "1.0"
        uuid = "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"

    keywords:
        $keyword1 = "example"
        
    condition:
        keywords.$keyword1
}
```

### After:
```nova
rule ExampleRule
{
    uuid = "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"

    meta:
        description = "Example rule"
        author = "Author Name"
        version = "1.0"
        direction = "input"

    keywords:
        $keyword1 = "example"
        
    condition:
        keywords.$keyword1

    falsepositives:
        "Legitimate use cases may exist"
        "Review in context"
}
```

## Notes
- All rules now follow a consistent format
- Direction field defaults to "input" unless specifically handling output
- False positives sections are contextually relevant to each rule
- Incident files that were missing UUIDs have been assigned new ones
- All changes maintain backward compatibility with the Nova framework

## Verification
Use the following command to verify all changes:
```bash
cd /home/robomotic/DevOps/github/nova-framework
git diff nova_rules/
```
