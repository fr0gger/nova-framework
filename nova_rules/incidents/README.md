# Incidents

This directory concerns reported incidents that have been publicly documented. For now, each of these detections are reconstructed using potential contents of the report. These largely consist of unclassified but sensitive strings.

Each incident should have a filename like:

`<yyyymm>_<description>.nov` 

One incident should only ever have one set of Nova rules. However, this can imply one report having multiple rules and files, if they map to distinct actors or are very semantically different. 

This might imply a single threat actor having multiple reporting files. In this case, one assumes one report maps to an unnamed cluster of incidents.

If you add an incident, add it to the table below for ease of use.
