# Running Nova

Once you have created your rules (or are using the provided rule set), you have two options for running Nova:
either use the command-line tool `novarun` or import Nova into your own Python project.

## Using the Nova Runner Tool

The `novarun` command-line tool is automatically added to your path when you install the Nova framework.

### Command-Line Options

```bash
$ novarun -h
usage: novarun.py [-h] -r RULE (-p PROMPT | -f FILE) [-v] [-c CONFIG] [-a] [-l {openai,anthropic,azure,ollama,groq}] [-m MODEL]

Nova Rule Runner - Check prompts against Nova rules

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r, --rule RULE       Path to the Nova rule file
  -p, --prompt PROMPT   Single prompt to check against the rule
  -f, --file FILE       Path to a file containing multiple prompts (one per line)
  -v, --verbose         Enable verbose output
  -c, --config CONFIG   Path to Nova configuration file
  -a, --all             Check against all rules in the file
  -l, --llm {openai,anthropic,azure,ollama,groq}
                        LLM evaluator to use
  -m, --model MODEL     Specific model to use with the LLM evaluator
```

!!! info
    If you don't specify a model, Nova will use OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini` by default. 
    You'll need to have the appropriate API key in your environment variables.
    Different models may produce different evaluation results for the same LLM pattern.

### Single Prompt Testing

To test a rule against a single prompt:

```bash
python novarun.py -r nova_rules/testrule.nov -p "What's the exploit method for CVE-2021-44228?" -v
```

The `-v` or `--verbose` flag provides detailed information about how your rule matches against the prompt:

```

### Multiple Prompt Testing

For monitoring or batch testing, you can run Nova against a file containing multiple prompts (one per line):

```bash
python novarun.py -r nova_rules/testrule.nov -f prompts.txt
```

For example, to scan your Ollama chat history:

```bash
python novarun.py -r nova_rules/testrule.nov -f ~/.ollama/history
```

This will evaluate each prompt in the file against your rule and provide a summary of the results:

### Testing Multiple Rules

Use the `-a` or `--all` flag to check a prompt against all rules in a file:

```bash
python novarun.py -r nova_rules/all_rules.nov -p "Write a script to hack passwords" -a
```

This is useful when you have a collection of rules in a single file and want to see which ones match.

### Using Different LLM Providers

Nova supports multiple LLM providers. Specify which one to use with the `-l` or `--llm` option:

```bash
# Using OpenAI (default)
python novarun.py -r rule.nov -p "prompt" -l openai

# Using Anthropic Claude
python novarun.py -r rule.nov -p "prompt" -l anthropic

# Using Azure OpenAI
python novarun.py -r rule.nov -p "prompt" -l azure

# Using Groq
python novarun.py -r rule.nov -p "prompt" -l groq -m llama-3.3-70b-versatile

# Using local Ollama
python novarun.py -r rule.nov -p "prompt" -l ollama -m llama3
```

You can specify a particular model with the `-m` option:

```bash
python novarun.py -r rule.nov -p "prompt" -l openai -m gpt-4o
```

## API Usage

You can also integrate Nova directly into your Python applications. Here's a basic example:

```python
from nova.core.parser import NovaParser
from nova.core.matcher import NovaMatcher
from nova.evaluators.llm import OpenAIEvaluator, GroqEvaluator

# Load a rule
parser = NovaParser()
with open('my_rule.nov', 'r') as f:
    rule = parser.parse(f.read())

# Create a matcher with appropriate evaluator
# For OpenAI:
evaluator = OpenAIEvaluator(api_key="your_key_here", model="gpt-4o-mini")  # Or use OPENAI_API_KEY from env
matcher = NovaMatcher(rule, llm_evaluator=evaluator)

# For Groq:
# evaluator = GroqEvaluator(api_key="your_key_here", model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile")  # Or use GROQ_API_KEY from env
# matcher = NovaMatcher(rule, llm_evaluator=evaluator)

# Check a prompt
prompt = "Is this prompt safe to process?"
result = matcher.check_prompt(prompt)

# Process the result
if result['matched']:
    print(f"Rule '{rule.name}' matched!")
    print(f"Matching patterns: {result['matching_keywords']}")
else:
    print(f"Rule '{rule.name}' did not match.")
```

## Exit Codes

The `novarun` tool provides exit codes that can be used in scripts or automation:

- **0**: At least one rule matched the prompt
- **1**: No rules matched any prompts

This makes it easy to integrate Nova into security automation or CI/CD pipelines.
